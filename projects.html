                        From looking at different travel magazines and social media posts from travel agencies, you can
                        see
                        multiple posts that promote an area in the world. Here I have taken a photo that I took over the
                        summer and edited it in Adobe Lightroom. Then turned it into a promotional post/cover in Adobe
                        Illustrator by using fonts that work well together and placement while still letting the
                        location
                        shine, to inspire other nature lovers to visit.

                    <h4>Portrait Photography</h4>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the start of my schooling I have learned more techniques for portrait photography. In
                        one of our classes we had to get into groups and take cohesive portraits. In mutual agreement we
                        set two lights up. One in front for the main lighting and one to the side to create contrast
                        between the person and the background. I took this photo in RAW, using the rule of threes and
                        making sure the focus sat correctly. With the rules of three I made sure the first thing you
                        notice when looking at the picture is her face and I also set the focus on the eyes to make sure
                        the photo didn’t set focus somewhere that would look unnatural.

                    <h4>Picture enhancement</h4>
                    <p>
                        A big part of what attracts travellers towards certain trips is the pictures they see, either on
                        a website or on social media. The photos used to promote certain trips need to accurately
                        represent possible experiences but in an enhanced light. This can be done through photo editing
                        - not to create something unrealistic but to enhance the viewing experience. Here is a photo I
                        took on safari a while back. Through Adobe Lightroom I enhanced the quality, contrast, color and
                        lighting to create a more eye-catching photo.Throughout the start of my schooling I have learned
