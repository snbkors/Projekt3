                        multiple posts that promote an area in the world. Here I have taken a photo that I took over the
                        summer and edited it in Adobe Lightroom. Then turned it into a promotional post/cover in Adobe
                        Illustrator by using fonts that work well together and placement while still letting the
                        location
                        shine, to inspire other nature lovers to visit.

                    <h4><b>Portrait Photography</b></h4>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the start of my schooling I have learned more techniques for portrait photography. In
                        one
                        of our classes we had to get into groups and take cohesive portraits. In mutual agreement we set
                        two
                        lights up. One in front for the main lighting and one to the side to create contrast between the
                        person and the background. I took this photo in RAW, using the rule of threes and making sure
                        the
                        focus sat correctly. With the rules of three I made sure the first thing you notice when looking
                        at
                        the picture is her face and I also set the focus on the eyes to make sure the photo didn’t set
                        focus
                        somewhere that would look unnatural.
